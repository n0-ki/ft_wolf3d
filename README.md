This projectâ€™s objectives:

Rigor, use of C, use
of basic algorithms, information research, data mining etc.
As a graphic design project, Wolf3D will enable you to solidify your skills in this area:
windows, colors, events, fill shapes etc.


To conclude Wolf3D is a remarkable playground to explore the playful practical applications
of mathematics without having to understand the specifics. 
You are welcome to use this as referance if you have any questions on Raycasting in C!

Make sure you have CMake!

You need to build the program by doing make all or make re!
